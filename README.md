# ClipToTube
Twitch clip to youtube

This bot will automatically download clips.twitch.tv highlights from reddit posts and upload them you YouTube, then post the link to the reddit thread.

There's not much to it. Most bots I've seen are done in py, so I'm here to show that C# is superior.

Official bot will post from http://www.reddit.com/u/ClipToTube
